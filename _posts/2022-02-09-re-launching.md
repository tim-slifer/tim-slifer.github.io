Hi. I'm back. Let's try this again.

If you were one of the handful of people to stop by my old site, you will have noticed it hadn't been touched in quite some time. I've scrapped that site and have started fresh here.

I'm still using Jekyll on GitHub Pages. I've adopted a new theme this time. I'm quite fond of [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy), despite the challenges I've encountered with customization. In fact, I'm not particularly sure the author really quite wanted that to happen. It's been fun diving down the Jekyll rabbit-hole, though.

I've also left the `.io` TLD in favor of `.dev`. I was quickly excited by the specific focus on developers and technology of `.dev`. Seeing that a number of my favorite projects had adopted the new TLD, I had no problems following suit. As cool as `.io` is, it seemed a little strange co-opting the TLD of what equates to a small island in the Indian Ocean for IT purposes.

My plans for the site remain more or less the same as last time... to have a platform from which I can share knowledge and experiences, and a means to meet and network with other like-minded engineers.

I'll be adding content here as I am able, hopefully with some kind of regularity. In the meantime, check out my other [projects]({{site.url}}/projects). My social sites are linked in the sidebar below, and if you'd like to get in touch, send me a message on either [Hearty](https://app.hearty.xyz/user/tim-slifer/) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timslifer/).

Thanks for stopping by.
