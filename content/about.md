I'm Tim. I'm a QA Engineer. My speciality is building QA teams from the ground up, integrating cross-functionally with other disciplines across the org, and setting up to scale as a company grows. I focus heavily on automation, but strive to build a fully documented and traceable suite of tests through both the manual and automated testing paths.

My work involves defining processes and procedures, ensuring the right people are in the appropriate roles, as well as choosing and deploying testing tools and frameworks. I also work closely with my teams to identify and solve testing challenges, be it concerning process accommodations, technical solutions, or skills enhancement.

My experience includes leading and managing teams in companies ranging from seed stage startups to Fortune 50 enterprises. I work to bring teams online, make them operational, and quickly adding value to both the testing efforts and general product quality. My role involves both strategic planning and hands-on participation through manual and automated testing, as well as communication of status both cross team and to project stakeholders.

I am also a strong advocate of the Culture of Quality concept. Quality is not bolted on at the end of a development cycle; it is baked in throughout the development process. Each team member from every discipline across the SDLC has a responsibility for ensuring quality within their areas of work.

If your team is ready to begin it's QA journey, looking to invest in automation, or modernize with new tools and strategies... or if you just want to talk some shop, drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timslifer/). I'd love to hear from you.
